```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```
Python and R are two languages used for coding. In this blog post, I am going to demonstrate coding with R and coding with python. I will then use reticulate to demonstrate how R code and python code communicate and can be used together. Finally, I will add an image of the Survivor logo to demonstrate inserting visuals in an R Markdown file.


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#R code
head(survivoR::castaways)
head(iris)

```
You can embed a Python code chunk like this:
```{python}
#python code
bgt = "brannon gray tatum"
bgt[0:12]

```
Here, reticulate is used to demonstrate how R and Python talk to each other and share information across code chunks: 
```{r}
#R code 
library(reticulate)
py_install("numpy")
name <- "I"
```
```{python}
#python code
name = "prefer to go by Gray"
print(r.name,name) #access R-defined objects with r. 
```

You can embed images like this Survivor logo:
